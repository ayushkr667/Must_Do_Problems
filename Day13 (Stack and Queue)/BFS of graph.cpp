// Given a directed graph. The task is to do Breadth First Traversal of this graph starting from 0.
// Note: One can move from node u to node v only if there's an edge from u to v and find the BFS 
// traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex, from left to right according to the graph. 
// Also, you should only take nodes directly or indirectly connected from Node 0 in consideration.

// Your task:
// You donâ€™t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function bfsOfGraph() 
// which takes the integer V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters 
// and returns  a list containing the BFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex from left to right.
